		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<h2>
		Hello, My name is Eddie Truong. I am currently a college student who is pursuing a degree in Computer Science at University of California Irvine. My expected graduation date will be on Winter 2017. There are many reasons why i wanted to become a programmer, but one thing that struck me the most was the ability to create something from nothing. The satisfication of seeing all your hardwork creating something extraordinary is mindblowing. Programming to me can be describe as a company. All the small functions within a program can come together and produce something amazing. I believe that software and technology is gonna change the way our world will work. It will solve many problems and help many around the world.<br>
		I am proficient in C++, Python, and Java.
		I also know MYSQL, HTML, CSS, and Unix.
		<br>
		I like to do backend development that organizes data and retrieves data for the front end. I also like to do software development and data management.
