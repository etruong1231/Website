	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<li>Currently exploring Machine learning and Deep learning</li>
		<div style="padding-left:50px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 100;">
		starting with simple machine learning algorithm that learns how to do simple bit arithmetic by training the program with input and outputs till it understands the problem and highly predict the answer of a problem.
		<br></br></div>

	<li>AI project</li>
		<div style="padding-left:50px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 100;">
		Currently writing a AI bot that plays Connect Four against another bot. It uses a depth first algorithm with alpha beta pruning that determines which path to take within the tree.
		</div><br>


	<li>Threading Project</li>
		<div style="padding-left:50px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 100;">
		Created a train simulation that deals with mutex and locks similar to an elevator problem. The train will work together and pick passengers up without interfering with each other. No more than one train can be at each station picking up passengers.
		</div><br>
	<li>Sorting Algorithms</li>
		<div style="padding-left:50px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 100;">Created serveral sorting algorithm that can sort numbers or characters. The program was written as a template so it can accept any type to organize. </div><br>
	<li>Graph Algorithms</li> 
		<div style="padding-left:50px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 100;">
		Created a graph with vertex and edges that depicts vertex as locations and the outgoing edges as the path from one location to another with total distance from each other and the speed of each road.
		</div><br>

	<li>Created A Website with AWS/Tomcat</li>
		<div style="padding-left:50px;font-size:20px;font-weight: 100;">
